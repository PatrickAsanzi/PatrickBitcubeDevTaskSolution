# BitcubeDevTask
The code contained in this repository is for a developer assessment task. It is written in C# using SQLite and follows a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach. This project showcases an API that supports user and product management, enabling users to create accounts, manage products, and perform checkout operations.

Key Features
User Management: Includes user registration and authentication using ASP.NET Core Identity, with a focus on security and best practices.

Product Management: Provides APIs to add, modify, delete, and list products. Each product is associated with a specific user to ensure proper ownership and access control.

Checkout Process: Implements a streamlined checkout experience, allowing users to enter product IDs and quantities, and provides clear error handling for invalid requests.

Data Storage: Utilizes SQLite for persistent storage, ensuring data integrity and ease of use.

API Documentation: Integrated with Swagger for interactive API documentation, making it easy for developers to explore and test endpoints.
